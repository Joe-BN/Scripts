Created to manage my configuration files for my ***NixOS***.

New to NixOS but wanted a simple way to track both my configuration files and .configs.
I did so by copying them to separate locations and tracking them with git
(it was both as a local backup and a way of control)

It manages the commits using rsync
Can easily be adupted to work with any number of files.

Current structure:
